Hi, I'm Morgan. I help folks figure out accomomdation solutions for employees in the workplace. It's like an IEP, but for your job.

## Not just for those who identify as disabled

Everyone can benefit from thinking about how to optimize their tech setup for ease of workflow. For instance, you might not identify as disabled, but you notice your wrists hurt after a long day of typing. 

## Services offered

### Workspace and store space evaluations

Let me look at your existing workspaces, whether that's a retail store, an open office plan, a desk in the corner of your living room, or anything else. Visits can be done virtually (anywhere) or in-person (in Ottawa).

### Individual consultations

I interview employees - whether they formally identify as disabled or not - from the perspective of "Hey, what tasks suck due to either pain or cognition (or both), and how can we use technology to make it suck less?"

### Tech and tech setup recommendations

Do you need a digital daytimer system that synchs into your email somehow? Do you need a texting or email app that lets you schedule your emails / texts so that your customers think you're operating during business hours? Have you considered a non traditional monitor layout?

I keep up with the latest in digital and physical accessibility tech so you don't have to. Usually, these are small tweaks, plugins, or workflow changes to your existing software - often, you don't even need to buy or install software at all!

### Break out of your normative tech assumptions

I love helping people step back and break out of normative tech assumptions. Your monitor doesn't have to be landscape on a desk. Keyboards aren't always rectangles. You technically don't need a mouse, and your mouse could look way different - why don't more people know about vertical mice?

Together, we will find what could be built better - and then build it.
